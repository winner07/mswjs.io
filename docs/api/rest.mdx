The `rest` namespace contains a set of [Request handlers](/docs/basics/request-handler) designed for convenient mocking of REST API requests.

## Methods

Methods of this namespace represents REST API request methods:

- `rest.get()`
- `rest.post()`
- `rest.put()`
- `rest.patch()`
- `rest.delete()`
- `rest.options()`

Using a method under this namespace automatically creates a request handler that matches any requests with the respective REST API method. Additionally, such request handler accepts a request URL as the first parameter to narrow the match.

```js showLineNumbers
import { rest } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  // Match a GET request to a third-party server.
  rest.get('https://api.github.com/user/:login', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ login: req.params.login }))
  }),

  // Match a POST request issued against the same origin
  // as the current application.
  rest.post('/author/:authorId/:postId', responseResolver),
]
```

### Custom methods

There are also custom methods that do not strictly represent REST API methods but provide a more convenient way to create request handlers.

- `rest.all()`

Intercept any REST API request to a given path regardless of its method.

```js showLineNumbers
import { rest } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  // Intercept all requests to the "/user" endpoint
  // regardless of their method, and respond with a "403 Forbidden" response.
  rest.all('/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.status(403))
  }),
]
```

> The path provided to `rest.all()` abides by the [Request matching](/docs/basics/request-matching) algorithm, meaning you can also use patterns and regular expressions.

## Examples

```js showLineNumbers
import { setupWorker, rest } from 'msw'

const worker = setupWorker(
  rest.get('/users/:userId', (req, res, ctx) => {
    const { userId } = req.params

    return res(
      ctx.json({
        id: userId,
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Maverick',
      }),
    )
  }),
)

worker.start()
```
